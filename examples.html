            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <p>Let's go through a few examples to see what each selector looks like and how they differ from one another.</p>
            <table>
                <tr><th>Example 1 - Type Selector</th></tr>
                <tr><td><img src="media/images/examples/example_alt1.png" alt=""></td></tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        This one is a <i>type selector</i> because it <u>doesn't have a pound or period preceding its name</u>,
                        and it contains the name 'div', meaning this will target every 'div' element and apply the color style
                        of red to it.
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <table>
                <tr><th>Example 2 - Class Selector</th></tr>
                <tr><td><img src="media/images/examples/example_alt2.png" alt=""></td></tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        At first glance you may think this is the same as the last example, but don't let names fool you! Even
                        though it's using the name of an HTML element, the selector is still a <i>class selector</i> because
                        the <u>'div' is preceded by a period</u>. Therefore, it will target every element that has the class
                        attribute of 'div' instead of all 'div' elements.
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <table>
                <tr><th>Example 3 - ID Selector</th></tr>
                <tr><td><img src="media/images/examples/example_alt3.png" alt=""></td></tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        This one is an <i>ID selector</i> because it has a pound symbol preceding its name, and it contains the name
                        'bell'. Because we are dealing with IDs, this means this will only target the one element with the ID
                        'bell'.
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <table>
                <tr><th>Example 4 - Grouped Selector</th></tr>
                <tr><td><img src="media/images/examples/example_alt4.png" alt=""></td></tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        This one has the <i>ID selector</i> for the 'bell' ID from the last example, alongside a <i>class selector</i>
                        for the 'taco' class. Because they're separated by a comma and next to the same style, they are <i>grouped</i>,
                        meaning the element with the 'bell' ID and all elements of the 'taco' class will get the color style of red.
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </main>
