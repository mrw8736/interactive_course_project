            <h2>Instruction</h2>
            <p>Selectors are used to in CSS to find the HTML elements you want to apply your styles to. They are “selecting”
                the element you want and adds the styles to it.
            </p>

            <p>There are three types of selectors you will be using, <u>type selectors</u>, <u>class selectors</u>, and
                <u>id selectors</u>.
            </p>

            <h3>Type Selectors</h3>
            <p><i>Type selectors</i> are the most basic selector. They use the name of an HTML element tag and apply the style
                to every element with that tag.
            </p>
            <p class="syn"><strong>Syntax:</strong> html_tag {style: value;}</p>

            <h3>Class Selectors</h3>
            <p><i>Classes</i> are attributes that can be added to any HTML element to categorize it. You can make the class
                name whatever you want and you can have as many HTML elements with same class as you'd like. It is added by
                adding the attribute to the element's tag like so:
            </p>
            <p>&lt; tag   class = 'class_name' &gt;</p>
            <p>To target elements with these classes, you will use <i>class selectors</i>, selectors that target all elements
                with the same class attribute and apply the style to those elements. The difference between the syntax of a
                class selector and a type selector is that the <u>class name must be preceded by a period (.)</u>.
            </p>
            <p class="syn"><strong>Syntax:</strong> .class_name {style: value;}</p>

            <h3>ID Selectors</h3>
            <p><i>IDs</i> work similarly to classes, as they are attribute that can be added to HTML elements and the ID name
                can be anything you want. Unlike classes, <u>unique IDs can only be applied to one element at a time</u>. They
                should only be used for elements you plan to single out in your HTML. You can add the attribute to the
                element's tag like so:
            </p>
            <p>&lt; tag   id = 'id_name' &gt;</p>
            <p>To target an element with an ID, you will use <i>id selectors</i>, selectors that target the element with the
                same ID attribute and apply the style to that element. The difference between the syntax of a id selector and
                other selectors is that the <u>ID name must be preceded by a pound symbol (#)</u>.
            </p>
            <p class="syn"><strong>Syntax:</strong> .id_name {style: value;}</p>

            <h3>Grouping Selectors</h3>
            <p>One last thing to know about is <i>grouping selectors</i>. If you want multiple element types, classes, and/or
                IDs to have the same styles, you can save time and space by applying the styles to a group of selectors.
                Simply list out the selectors and divide them with commas, like so:
            </p>
            <p class="syn"><strong>Syntax:</strong> selector1, .selector2, #selector3 {style: value;}</p>
        </main>
    </body>
