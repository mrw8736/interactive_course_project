            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>By the end of Unit 2, we want you to be able to make your own style sheet you can use for your website. In
                this module, you will learn about selectors, grouping selectors, and the three types of selectors you will be
                using the most. They will be what you code first before any style pairs, telling your styles which element or
                elements they should target in your HTML file. This module will consist of a section for instruction, a series
                of examples and nonexamples, practice exercises, and a self-test.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Is This Important?</h2>
            <p>Style pairs are useless if they don't have an element or elements to target, and a selector's job is to direct
                the styles to where they need to go, a job just as important as the styles pairs themselves. It's important to
                know how to direct your styles at the elements you want. If you want to direct your styles at one specific
                element, a large overarching group of elements, or a specific set of elements, you need to specify that through
                your selector. This unit will make sure your styles go where they need to go.
