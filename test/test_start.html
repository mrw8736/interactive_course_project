                After you have reviewed all the material and feel confident with the practice questions, you can move on to
                the self-test section. <strong>You must answer 75% of the questions correctly to pass.</strong> You may
                attempt the quiz as many times as you need. An answer key can be activated after you have passed. If you are
                still confused or have questions about the selectors, see you instructor for clarification or any questions
                you might have.
